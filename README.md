# LDM_CT

First, Download the pretrained Variational AutoEncoder(VAE) and Latent-Diffusion Model(LDM) for CT checkpoint for this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q-6VF3If4GM5AaE3iF-I8KqQ43MOdqNz?usp=sharing). Make sure that the path of checkpoint of LDM is ./checkpoint/model_ckpt.pth and VAE is ./checkpoint/vae_ldm8/vae_ckpt.pth

After that, execute the sample_ldm.py to perform CT denoising with my proposed algorithm.
